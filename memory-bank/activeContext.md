# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Planning the implementation of an automated invoice extraction and Google Sheets integration system
- Defining the data schema for invoice extraction
- Creating a comprehensive implementation plan with clear phases and tasks

## Current Tasks
- Memory bank initialization completed
- Data schema definition completed
- Implementation plan created with three phases:
  1. Foundation & Core Components
  2. Mode Implementation
  3. Quality Assurance

## Recent Decisions
- Decision to prioritize data schema implementation as the first step
- Decision to enhance invoice parsing for layout adaptability as a critical component
- Decision to adapt OAuth flow for single-user, dual-API (Gmail & Sheets) access
- Decision to implement the project in three phases with a 6-9 week timeline

## Open Questions
- What specific invoice types need to be supported?
- What is the best approach for line item extraction with table detection?
- How to handle OCR failures and partial data extraction?
- Are there any specific requirements for the CLI interface?
