# Testing Strategy: Integration Throughout Implementation Phases

## Overview

Testing is a critical component of the OCR invoice processing system and should be integrated throughout all phases of implementation, not just as a final step. This document outlines how testing will be integrated into each phase of the implementation plan to ensure quality, reliability, and accuracy at every stage.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Components Testing

### 1. Data Schema Implementation & Normalization Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Create tests for data validation functions to verify they correctly validate against the schema
- **Property-Based Tests**: Generate random data to test normalization functions for dates, currency values, and text fields
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test handling of missing or malformed data
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage of all validation and normalization code

### 2. Invoice Parsing for Layout Adaptability Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test regex pattern configurations for each invoice type
- **Integration Tests**: Test the invoice type detection logic with sample invoices
- **Sample Invoice Tests**: Create a test suite with sample invoices of different formats
- **Line Item Extraction Tests**: Specifically test the line item extraction with various table formats
- **Normalization Tests**: Verify extracted data is correctly normalized according to schema requirements
- **Test Fixtures**: Create fixtures representing different invoice layouts

### 3. OAuth Flow Testing
- **Mock Tests**: Create mock tests for OAuth authentication flow
- **Integration Tests**: Test token refresh and handling of expired tokens
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test various authentication failure scenarios
- **Security Tests**: Verify secure handling of credentials and tokens

### 4. Google Sheets Integration Testing
- **Mock API Tests**: Test Sheets API interactions with mock responses
- **Format Conversion Tests**: Test conversion of invoice data to sheet formats
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test API failure scenarios and retry logic
- **Batch Processing Tests**: Test handling of multiple invoices in batch

## Phase 2: Mode Implementation Testing

### 5. Local PDF Batch Processing Testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end processing of sample PDFs
- **Configuration Tests**: Test loading and validation of configuration
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test recovery from processing failures
- **Performance Tests**: Test processing time for batches of different sizes

### 6. Gmail Integration Testing
- **Mock API Tests**: Test Gmail API interactions with mock responses
- **Email Filtering Tests**: Test email search and filtering logic
- **Attachment Processing Tests**: Test downloading and processing of attachments
- **Email Organization Tests**: Test labeling and organization features

### 7. CLI Interface Testing
- **Command-Line Argument Tests**: Test parsing of different command-line arguments
- **Mode Selection Tests**: Test mode selection logic
- **Configuration Tests**: Test loading and validation of configuration files
- **User Feedback Tests**: Test progress reporting and error feedback

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Quality Assurance

### 8. System-Wide Testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows from PDF to Google Sheets
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure new features don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under various loads
- **Stress Tests**: Test system behavior with large numbers of invoices
- **Security Tests**: Verify secure handling of sensitive data

### 9. Documentation and Deployment Testing
- **Documentation Tests**: Verify accuracy and completeness of documentation
- **Installation Tests**: Test installation process on different environments
- **Configuration Tests**: Test configuration options and their effects
- **User Guide Tests**: Verify user guides accurately reflect system behavior

## Continuous Integration & Testing

Throughout all phases, we will implement:

1. **Automated Test Runs**: Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically on code changes
2. **Test Coverage Reporting**: Track and maintain high test coverage
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
4. **Regression Test Suite**: Maintain a suite of tests to prevent regressions

## Test Environment

- **Test Data**: Create a repository of test invoices representing different formats
- **Mock Services**: Create mock implementations of Google APIs for testing
- **Test Configuration**: Create separate configuration for testing environments

## Success Criteria

- All critical components have 90%+ test coverage
- All tests pass before merging new code
- End-to-end tests verify complete system functionality
- Performance tests verify system meets performance requirements
